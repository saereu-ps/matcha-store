# Example: Todo App

This directory contains example AI-DLC artifacts for a simple **Todo App** feature. These files show what AI-DLC generates at each phase of the workflow.

## What's Here

| File | Phase | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `context.md` | Context | Project landscape assessment — greenfield TypeScript/Express/PostgreSQL |
| `requirements.md` | Requirements | 5 user stories with EARS acceptance criteria |
| `design.md` | Design | Compact design with architecture, components, data model, API spec |
| `tasks.md` | Tasks | Implementation tasks with execution waves and file ownership |

In a real project, these files would live at `.aidlc/specs/todo-app/`.

## About This Example

- **Project type**: Greenfield
- **Stack**: TypeScript / Express / PostgreSQL / Prisma
- **Complexity**: Simple (5 stories, 1 domain, 1 user type)
- **Design format**: Compact (single file, since ≤10 stories)
- **Workflow path**: Context → Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implement

This example follows the simple project path — no decomposition, no foundation, no units. For complex project examples with multiple units and incremental delivery, see the AI-DLC documentation.

## How These Were Generated

Each file was produced by its corresponding AI-DLC skill:

1. `aidlc-context` scanned the workspace and produced `context.md`
2. `aidlc-requirements` translated context into user stories in `requirements.md`
3. `aidlc-design` made technology decisions and produced `design.md`
4. `aidlc-tasks` broke the design into sequenced tasks in `tasks.md`

Decision gates (D1–D4) were answered at each phase but are not included here — they live in the workflow directory during actual use.
